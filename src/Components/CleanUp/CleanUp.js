		<p>If you don't normally wear makeup, it is good to be aware that you will need a separate makeup remover to take your waterproof bridal makeup off.</p>
		<p>Some waterproof makeup remover options:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Wipes:  They are like baby wipes for your face, wiping makeup away. (Options: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Neutrogena-Makeup-Remover-Cleansing-Towelettes/dp/B00MLBPDQ2/ref=sr_1_4_s_it?s=beauty&ie=UTF8&qid=1509557884&sr=1-4&keywords=neutrogena%2Bmakeup%2Bremover&dpID=41r4DCx4yaL&preST=_SY300_QL70_&dpSrc=srch&th=1">Neutrogena</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Yes-Cucumbers-Soothing-Hypoallergenic-Facial/dp/B005FVSH0O/ref=sr_1_2_s_it?s=beauty&ie=UTF8&qid=1509557927&sr=1-2&keywords=yes+to+cucumber+makeup+remover&dpID=41baAeQ3uKL&preST=_SY300_QL70_&dpSrc=srch">Yes to Cucumber</a>, or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Simple-Kind-Eyes-Makeup-Remover/dp/B00AO4EKSU/ref=sr_1_6_s_it?s=beauty&ie=UTF8&qid=1509557955&sr=1-6&keywords=simple+makeup+remover&dpID=41rZ3brtRZL&preST=_SY300_QL70_&dpSrc=srch">Simple</a>)</li>
			<li>Micellar Water:  Soak cotton pads with the solution, hold it against your closed eyes to dissolve your makeup and wipe it away.  Repeat as many times as needed with fresh cotton pads until the pad finishes clean. (Options: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/BIODERMA-Sensibio-Micellar-Water-8-33/dp/B0036SFTK4/ref=sr_1_6_s_it?s=beauty&ie=UTF8&qid=1509558267&sr=1-6&keywords=micellar%2Bwater&dpID=41Vs2Ll6e9L&preST=_SY300_QL70_&dpSrc=srch&th=1">Bioderma</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Garnier-SkinActive-Micellar-Cleansing-Water/dp/B017PCGABI/ref=sr_1_4_s_it?s=beauty&ie=UTF8&qid=1509558267&sr=1-4&keywords=micellar+water&dpID=415AdUVVeSL&preST=_SY300_QL70_&dpSrc=srch">Garnier</a>, or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Simple-Kind-Cleansing-Water-Micellar/dp/B00PATJ796/ref=sr_1_5_s_it?s=beauty&ie=UTF8&qid=1509558267&sr=1-5&keywords=micellar%2Bwater&dpID=41hGoTtykSL&preST=_SY300_QL70_&dpSrc=srch&th=1">Simple</a>)</li>
			<li>Cleansing Oil:  <a href="https://www.maccosmetics.com/product/13826/25558/products/skincare/removers/cleanse-off-oil-sized-to-go">MAC Cleanse Off Oil</a> starts off like an oil that you rub onto your dry face to break down your makeup, then when you rinse it off with water, it foams up rinsing your makeup away.
			</li>
			<li>Natural Oil:  I've used <a href="https://www.rockymountainoils.com/shoprmo/catalog/carrier-oils/apricot-oil.html">apricot oil</a> to take off my makeup for the past year.  I've heard some people use olive oil if you have it in the house.  I just rub it onto my dry face to dissolve makeup, and wipe it off with a warm wet washcloth (warning, cloth will look hideous afterwards).</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Follow up any of these methods with washing your face with your usual face soap. Usually, a little bit of mascara can still be around your eyes. Running a Q-tip along your lashline can take care of that easily.</p>
