		<h2>Clean Up</h2>
		<p>Since you don't normally wear makeup, it is good to be aware that you will need a separate makeup remover to take your waterproof bridal makeup off.</p>
		<p>Some options:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Wipes:  They are like a baby wipe for your face (Options: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Neutrogena-Makeup-Remover-Cleansing-Towelettes/dp/B00MLBPDQ2/ref=sr_1_4_s_it?s=beauty&ie=UTF8&qid=1509557884&sr=1-4&keywords=neutrogena%2Bmakeup%2Bremover&dpID=41r4DCx4yaL&preST=_SY300_QL70_&dpSrc=srch&th=1">Neutrogena</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Yes-Cucumbers-Soothing-Hypoallergenic-Facial/dp/B005FVSH0O/ref=sr_1_2_s_it?s=beauty&ie=UTF8&qid=1509557927&sr=1-2&keywords=yes+to+cucumber+makeup+remover&dpID=41baAeQ3uKL&preST=_SY300_QL70_&dpSrc=srch">Yes to Cucumber</a>, or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Simple-Kind-Eyes-Makeup-Remover/dp/B00AO4EKSU/ref=sr_1_6_s_it?s=beauty&ie=UTF8&qid=1509557955&sr=1-6&keywords=simple+makeup+remover&dpID=41rZ3brtRZL&preST=_SY300_QL70_&dpSrc=srch">Simple</a>)</li>
			<li>Micellar Water:  Need cotton pads (Options: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/BIODERMA-Sensibio-Micellar-Water-8-33/dp/B0036SFTK4/ref=sr_1_6_s_it?s=beauty&ie=UTF8&qid=1509558267&sr=1-6&keywords=micellar%2Bwater&dpID=41Vs2Ll6e9L&preST=_SY300_QL70_&dpSrc=srch&th=1">Bioderma</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Garnier-SkinActive-Micellar-Cleansing-Water/dp/B017PCGABI/ref=sr_1_4_s_it?s=beauty&ie=UTF8&qid=1509558267&sr=1-4&keywords=micellar+water&dpID=415AdUVVeSL&preST=_SY300_QL70_&dpSrc=srch">Garnier</a>, or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Simple-Kind-Cleansing-Water-Micellar/dp/B00PATJ796/ref=sr_1_5_s_it?s=beauty&ie=UTF8&qid=1509558267&sr=1-5&keywords=micellar%2Bwater&dpID=41hGoTtykSL&preST=_SY300_QL70_&dpSrc=srch&th=1">Simple</a>)</li>
			<li>Oil:  I've used <a href="https://www.rockymountainoils.com/shoprmo/catalog/carrier-oils/apricot-oil.html">apricot oil</a> to take off my makeup for the past year.  I've heard some people use olive oil if you have it in the house.  I just rub it onto my dry face to disolve makeup, and wipe it off with a warm wet washcloth (warning, cloth will look hideous afterwards, but washes out fine in laundry).</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Follow up any of these methods with washing your face with your usual face soap.</p>
	
		<h3>Here is what oil cleansing looks like (aka a great Halloween costume)</h3>

		<p>Usually, a little bit of mascara can still be around your eyes.  Q-tips take care of that easily.</p>
